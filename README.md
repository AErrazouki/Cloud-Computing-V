# Description of the two documents:
## Cloud Computing Report TP1:
This report explores the use of Proxmox VE, a type 2 hypervisor, for managing virtual machines. It focuses on configuring virtual machines with Ubuntu and testing network communication between Proxmox and the virtualized systems. The project demonstrates how virtual environments can optimize resource allocation and improve infrastructure flexibility using VMware Workstation and Proxmox VE.

## Cloud Computing Report TP2:
This report implements VMware ESXi, a type 1 hypervisor, to optimize resource management in an environment through virtualization. It involves setting up virtual machines for critical services such as a web server, mail server, and NAS for file storage. The goal is to improve flexibility, security, and cost-efficiency through virtualization. Services such as Apache, MySQL, PHP, Postfix, iRedMail, and FreeNAS are used to demonstrate the deployment of practical solutions.
